<b><h1> Insurance Premium Prediction Model </h1> </b>

<h2>Overview:-</h2>

This project involves building a machine learning model that predicts insurance premiums based on various features such as health status, age, smoking habits, 
number of children, marital status, and other relevant factors. The aim is to provide a reliable and efficient way to estimate insurance costs for individuals 
based on their personal and health-related information.

<h2>Features:-</h2>

The model predicts insurance premiums based on the following features:

Age: The age of the individual.

Sex: The gender of the individual.

BMI:- Bmi value

Smoking Status: Whether the individual smokes or not.

No. of Children: The number of children the individual has.

Region: Whhere the individual lives.

Expenses:- What is the luxuries and level of standard.

<h2>Usage:-</h2>

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/khan-408/Insurance-Premium-Prediction
```

<h2>Installation:-</h2>

To run this project, you'll need to have Python installed on your machine along with the necessary libraries. You can install the required packages by running:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running
To run the application on local Server
```
python application.py
```


## Model Training:-

The model is trained using a machine learning algorithm (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, ExtraTreeRegressor, Gradient Boosting Machine). The training process involves:

## Data Cleaning: 
Handling missing values and outliers.

## Feature Engineering:
Creating new features or modifying existing ones to improve model performance.

## Model Selection:
Choosing the best algorithm based on performance metrics.

## Training and Evaluation: 
Training the model on the training dataset and evaluating its performance on the test dataset.

## Results:-

The model achieved a satisfactory level of accuracy in predicting insurance premiums, with performance metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and RÂ² score indicating its effectiveness.
